## IBM February 2023 Ponder This Research Challenge
**Problem**: Find a placement of n=20 queens on an n\times n board such that no pair of queens threatens each other, and the number of different ways to place n kings on the safe squares without any pair of kings currently threatening one another is 48.

I participated in this challenge while taking "Intro to Artificial Intelligence" at the University of Kansas. For my solution, I implemented a hill climbing algorithm to generate feasible board configurations until a solution was found.
